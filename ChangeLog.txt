Modified GLScene.pas

Modified MeshUtils.pas

Both RemapReferences used a TByteArray for lists than can be
longer than the max number of 32768 items supported by the
TByteArray. By default the GLScene package has Range checking
turned off and thus hides the problem. 
Fixed bug in RemapReferences limiting lists to 32768 items.
Carsten Pohl submitted the bug and a solution that is
implemented here.

Modified GLScene.pas
Changed CoordinateChanged to deal with Rotation vector changes
as recommended by "fig". Changes to the rotation vector had no
effect on the object. The modification now allows values to be
assigned to the Ratiation vector that will affect the objects
orientation.

Modified GLSkyDome.pas
The EarthSkyDome also showed as pmLines, When polygon mode of
other objects in a scene were set to pmLines. Fixed a small bug
to properly deal with polygon fill as suggested by "fig"


24 Jun 2006 - PvD

Modified GLSceneVCL.rc, GLSceneVCL.dcr
Added glscene_icon_TGLPhongShader.bmp and
glscene_icon_TGLLinePFXManager.bmp compiled missing bitmap dcr
icon resources for TGLPhongshader and TGLLinePFXManager

Modified GLSceneEdit.pas
Fixed bug with DELETE key when editing name in Treeview. The
"Delete object" dialog was shown every time the DELETE key was
pressed while editing an object name in the Treeview. Now this
dialog is now shown while editing an object name in the treeview


20 Jun 2006 - PvD

Modified GLScene.pas, info.pas 
Added new tab to info form to show GLScene version number as
defined by the GLSCENE_VERSION constant in GLScene.pas. Also
